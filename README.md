> Self identifying base encodings

Multibase is a protocol for disambiguating the encoding of base-encoded (e.g.,
base32, base64, base58, etc.) binary appearing in text.

When text is encoded as bytes, we can usually use a one-size-fits-all encoding
(UTF-8) because we're always encoding to the same set of 256 bytes (+/- the NUL
byte). When that doesn't work, usually for historical or performance reasons, we
can usually infer the encoding from the context.

However, when bytes are encoded as text (using a base encoding), the base choice
of base encoding is often restricted by the context. Worse, these restrictions
can change based on where the data appears in the text. In some cases, we can
only use `[a-z0-9]`. In others, we can use a larger set of characters but need a
compact encoding. This has lead to a large set of "base encodings", one for
every use-case. Unlike when encoding text to bytes, we can't just standardize
around a single base encoding because there is no optimal encoding for all
cases.

Unfortunately, it's not always clear *what* base encoding is used; that's where
multibase comes in. It answers the question:

> Given data d encoded into text s, what base is it encoded with?

## Format

The Format is:

```
<base-encoding-character><base-encoded-data>
```

Where `<base-encoding-character>` is used according to the multibase table.

### Multibase Table v1.0.0-RC (semver)

The current multibase table is [here](multibase.csv):

```
encoding,           code, description
identity,           0x00, 8-bit binary (encoder and decoder keeps data unmodified)
base1,              1,    unary (11111)
base2,              0,    binary (01010101)
base8,              7,    octal
base10,             9,    decimal
base16,             f,    hexadecimal
base16upper,        F,    hexadecimal
base32hex,          v,    rfc4648 no padding - highest char
base32hexupper,     V,    rfc4648 no padding - highest char
base32hexpad,       t,    rfc4648 with padding
base32hexpadupper,  T,    rfc4648 with padding
base32,             b,    rfc4648 no padding
base32upper,        B,    rfc4648 no padding
base32pad,          c,    rfc4648 with padding
base32padupper,     C,    rfc4648 with padding
base32z,            h,    z-base-32 (used by Tahoe-LAFS)
base58flickr,       Z,    base58 flicker
base58btc,          z,    base58 bitcoin
base64,             m,    rfc4648 no padding
base64pad,          M,    rfc4648 with padding - MIME encoding
base64url,          u,    rfc4648 no padding
base64urlpad,       U,    rfc4648 with padding
```

**NOTE:** Multibase-prefixes are encoding agnostic. "z" is "z", not 0x7a ("z" encoded as ASCII/UTF-8). For example, in UTF-32, "z" would be `[0x7a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]`.

## Multibase By Example

Consider the following encodings of the same binary string:

```
4D756C74696261736520697320617765736F6D6521205C6F2F # base16 (hex)
JV2WY5DJMJQXGZJANFZSAYLXMVZW63LFEEQFY3ZP           # base32
YAjKoNbau5KiqmHPmSxYCvn66dA1vLmwbt                 # base58
TXVsdGliYXNlIGlzIGF3ZXNvbWUhIFxvLw==               # base64
```

And consider the same encodings with their multibase prefix

```
F4D756C74696261736520697320617765736F6D6521205C6F2F # base16 F
BJV2WY5DJMJQXGZJANFZSAYLXMVZW63LFEEQFY3ZP           # base32 B
zYAjKoNbau5KiqmHPmSxYCvn66dA1vLmwbt                 # base58 z
MTXVsdGliYXNlIGlzIGF3ZXNvbWUhIFxvLw==               # base64 M
```

The base prefixes used are: `F, B, z, M`.


## FAQ

> Is this a real problem?

Yes. If i give you `"1214314321432165"` is that decimal? or hex? or something else? See also:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_clean
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8571501/how-to-check-whether-the-string-is-base64-encoded-or-not

> Why the strange selection of codes / characters?

The code values are selected such that they are included in the alphabets of the base they represent. For example, `f` is the base code for `base16 (hex)`, because `f` is in hex's 16 character alphabet. Note that the alphabets can be encoded in ASCII or UTF8. We have not found a case needing something else.

> Don't we have to agree on a table of base encodings?

Yes, but we already have to agree on base encodings, so this is not hard. The table even leaves some room for custom encodings.

## Disclaimers

Warning: **obviously multibase changes the first character depending on the encoding**. Do not expect the value to be exactly the same. Remove the multibase prefix before using the value.
